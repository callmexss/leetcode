# Testcase Example:  '[2,7,11,15]\n9'
#
# Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they
# add up to a specific target.
# 
# You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may
# not use the same element twice.
# 
# Example:
# 
# 
# Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,
# 
# Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
# return [0, 1].
#

class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        hash_table = {}

        for i, num in enumerate(nums):
            if target - num in hash_table:
                return [hash_table[target - num], i]
            hash_table[num] = i

        return []
