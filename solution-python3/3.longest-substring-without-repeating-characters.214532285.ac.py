# Testcase Example:  '"abcabcbb"'
#
# Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating
# characters.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: "abcabcbb"
# Output: 3 
# Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3. 
# 
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: "bbbbb"
# Output: 1
# Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
# 
# 
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# 
# Input: "pwwkew"
# Output: 3
# Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3. 
# ⁠            Note that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a
# subsequence and not a substring.

class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
        lastseen = {}
        start = 0
        longest = 0

        for i, c in enumerate(s):
            if c in lastseen and lastseen [c] >= start:
                start = lastseen[c] + 1
            else:
                longest = max(longest, i - start + 1)

            lastseen[c] = i
        return longest
